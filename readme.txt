This map displays the locations and number of marijuana-related arrests in 2006 in NYC. I created this map because I found it interesting to explore the reasons behind why people were arrested for marijuana charges before it was legalized.

I was trying to make a plugin called mapbox-gl-compare but couldn't figure it out. I hope to figure it out for the final. I wanted to show arrests in 2006 and 2019 to show the steep decline (only 7 arrests in 2019).

I did figure out how to make the buildings 3D when you zoom in. No real reason to do that now, but will be helpful on final.

I also tried to show police precincts to no avail. I wanted to create a hover effect for the precincts but couldn't get the geojson to load.
